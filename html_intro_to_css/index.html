        <h2>How does littering effect the environment?</h2>
        <p>Litter consists of waste products that have been discarded incorrectly, without consent, at an unsuitable location. The word litter can also be used as a verb: to litter means to drop and leave objects, often man-made, such as aluminum cans, paper cups, food wrappers, cardboard boxes or plastic bottles on the ground, and leave them there indefinitely or for other people to dispose of as opposed to disposing of them correctly.

            Large and hazardous items of rubbish such as tires, electrical appliances, electronics, batteries and large industrial containers are sometimes dumped in isolated locations, such as national forests and other public lands.
            
            Litter is a type of human impact on the environment and remains a serious environmental problem in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before decomposition and be transported over large distances into the world's oceans. Litter can affect the quality of life.
            
            Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with 4.5 trillion discarded each year.[1] Estimates of the required time for cigarette butts to break down vary, ranging from 5 to 400 years for complete degradation</p>

            <p>Littering — or what littering means to us today —  is actually a rather modern problem. It was not until roughly the 1950s that manufacturers began producing a higher volume of litter-generating products and packaging made of materials like plastic. You couldn’t toss a styrofoam cup out of your window back then because there are not any styrofoam cups in existence to throw away. 

                Still, the incidences of littering grew swiftly in those short few decades. Increases in littering and illegal dumping contribute to air pollution, land pollution and ocean pollution. For example, approximately 8 million tons of plastic waste finds its way into our oceans every year. 
                
                It can be difficult to fully comprehend the monumental effects throwing a cup out a window or dropping food packaging on the ground can have. The following littering facts aim to shed light on what littering is, why people litter, how litter affects the environment and what you can do to end littering and encourage others to do the same.</p>
