        <h2>Wild life is important.</h2>
        <p>Litter cleanup cost in the United States total more than $11.5 billion each year! Litter can lead to soil, water, and air pollution. Trash along our Raleigh roads can serve as a breeding ground for insects and rodents. Litter can be composed of flammable materials that could immediately start a fire. Trash on our roads and highways can lead to accidents. And millions of animals die each year as a result of ingesting harmful objects or becoming entangled in littered substances.

            Most plastics do not decay. So, when items like plastic bottles and bags get into streams, they can harm wildlife and eventually end up in the ocean. This contributes to a major pollution problem around the world.Litter is defined as waste products that have not been discarded properly. Litter endangers our environment, our wildlife, and our economy. It pollutes our neighborhoods, decreases property values, and destroys our city's natural beauty.

            The ideal way to handle the problem of littering is to prevent it in the first place. Let's all take responsibility and try our best to properly dispose of waste!</p>

   <h2> Tips-help-prevent-litter</h2>         

            <p>Bring Your Own (BYO…)  Reusable bags to the store, water bottles to the gym or the park, beverage mug to the coffee shop…you get the idea. The 3 R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) still ring true. The fewer single-use products you buy, the less trash you create.
                Dont litter. Make an extra effort to place your trash in the nearest trash bin. Keep garbage and recycling cans tightly covered to prevent litter from being blown away or scattered by animals. 
                Cover your load. If you have a truck, cover any items that could blow onto the road.
                Pick it up. Show you care for your community and inspire others by picking up litter that is not yours. Go one step further and help organize a community clean-up with your neighbors and friends.
                Green your garden. Use non-toxic pest control methods, conserve water, and befriend native plants to keep your garden happy and healthy.
                Encourage local businesses to reuse, recycle, and generate less packaging. Ask your local stores and shops if they recycle or take back packaging, fluorescent bulbs, batteries, etc.
                Support manufacturers who are eco-friendly. Encourage the use of green design and support manufacturers who take responsibility for their products at the end of their usefulness. Vote with your dollars!
                Drop off items that can not go in the trash. Contact the San Mateo County Household Hazardous Waste Program or visit our household hazardous waste page to learn about the proper disposal of common household toxic products that require special care.
                Get Involved! Help local waterways by cleaning up litter with us. Check out our calendar to find events to participate in and build a stronger community. </p>
